Description: # Cloud Firewall
        =================
        
        Cloud Firewall provides firewall for distributed servers across 
        different cloud providers. While each of the cloud providers have 
        their own firewall solutions, it can be difficult to maintain consistency
        across them. Cloud firewall provides a single dashboard to manage the 
        firewall rules across all cloud providers.
        
        Cloud firewall does not depend on the firewall service provided by the 
        cloud providers, instead the firewall rules are applied at the individual 
        server level using `nftables` package. In that sense, cloud firewall works
        independently of the cloud providers.
